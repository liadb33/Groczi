## **Project Overview**  
**Groczi** is a grocery shopping optimization app that helps users save both time and money. By comparing grocery prices across nearby supermarkets in real time, Groczi identifies the most cost-effective stores for an entire shopping list. Combining dynamic pricing data, geolocation, and user-centric features, Groczi enhances the shopping experience and bridges the gaps left by existing platforms like Instacart and Flipp.
